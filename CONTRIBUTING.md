# Installing clmp for development

These instructions are written for someone who wants to compile *clmp* from source and contribute to its development.  If you only want to use the package, please download a release (when we have them!) and eventually we hope to have this package available to install through the usual R package managers.

## On Ubuntu
1. Install `igraph` with the `apt` package manager.
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libigraph0-dev
  ```
2. Install `gsl` with `apt`:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libgsl-dev
  ```
