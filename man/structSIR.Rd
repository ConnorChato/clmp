\title{Forward simulation of SIR dynamics in a structured population}
\description{
This is a phylogenetic tree loaded as an object of class "phylo".
It was generated by the forward-simulation program MASTER v6.0.0 (Vaughan and Drummond 2013) under a susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model of two subpopulations with divergent transmission rates.
Tip labels of the tree contain the substring \code{I_1} if the lineage was sampled from the high-transmission rate subpopulation and \code{I_0} otherwise.
Thus, the \code{I_1} tips should be assigned to clusters and the \code{I_0} tips should be assigned to the background.
